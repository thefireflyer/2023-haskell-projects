<h1 id="me">TheFireFlyer</h1>

Hi! I'm Aidan (they/she), though I mostly go by thefireflyer online. I'm an undergrad studying computer science and sociology. Though, I adore just about everything computers, math, and social science.

The goal of this page is to be a stable, accessible, place to link to.

I mostly write software, but I do occasionally post other forms of writing. I also do photography from time to time. Important stuff should be listed below.
