# Preface

Last quarter we discussed, among other things, the Skeptical Paradox.

The Skeptical paradox goes like so:
1. I know I have hands.
1. If I know I have hands, then I know I'm not a hand-less brain-in-a-vat.
1. I don't know that I'm not a hand-less brain-in-a-vat.

Since there are three premises to this paradox, there are three solutions:
1. Reject the first claim. So, I don't know I have hands.
1. Reject the second claim. So, I can both know I have hands and also not know that I'm not a hand-less BIV.
1. Reject the third claim. So, I do know that I'm not a hand-less BIV.

We quickly dismissed solution (2) since it isn't consistent with our logic system.

This left solutions (1) and (3). 

We then discussed two arguments: the Moorean argument and the Skeptical argument.

The Moorean argument says:
1. I know I have hands.
1. If I know I have hands, then I know I'm not a BIV.
1. So, I'm not a BIV.

So, we see that the Moorean argument supports solution (1).

The Skeptical argument says:
1. I don't know that I'm not a BIV.
1. If I know I have hands, then I know I'm not a BIV.
1. So, I must not know I have hands.

So, the Skeptical argument supports solution (3).

We then presented the following argument:
1. If a claim is a massive afront to commonsense, it is probably wrong.
1. Claim (3) in the Skeptical argument---that I don't know I have have hands---is a massive afront to commonsense.
1. So, claim (3) is probably wrong.
1. So, the Skeptical argument is probably wrong.

We noted that this argument is deeply flawed. Specifically, claim (1) is wrong. For example, it is a massive afront to commonsense that a feather would fall at the same speed as a 10-story brick building in a vacuum, and yet, it is true.

So, we proposed a new argument:
1. A claim is true _iff_ it "agrees with" human language.
1. An valid argument is sound _iff_ all of its claims "agree with" human language.
1. Claim (3) of the Skeptical argument does **not** "agree with" human language.
1. So, the argument must not be sound.
1. Moreover, claim (3) of the Moorean argument "agrees with" human language _more than_ claim (3) of the Skeptical argument.
1. So, the Moorean argument is, at very least, "better" in this sense.

I noted that there are problems with this argument, but I didn't go into detail back then. Now, I will.

The issue is that there are unsound argument that "agree with" human language. For example, ...

So, this really prompts the question: how do we actually argue about non-falsifiable things? 

More generally, how do we tell if something is true?
